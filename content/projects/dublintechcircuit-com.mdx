Dublin Tech Circuit is Ireland's first ever student-led community of technology enthusiasts that fosters peer-to-peer learning through intra-school collaboration and inter-school competition, covering all things related to technology.

â€‹Just as every school has a sports team, the Dublin Tech Circuit empowers students to create their own school tech team rooted in Digital Literacy (Programming, Robotics, Photography, Film-making, Digital Art, Animation, 3D-Modeling, Game Development & eSports).
Students conduct trials and weekly training sessions that enhance their skills and foster a peer-to-peer learning environment.
The teams compete against other schools in year-round offline events, with points earned contributing to an overall school leaderboard for the season.
